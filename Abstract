Abstract 
Education providers in the technical field usually receive large numbers of requests by students, 
parents, and personnel, particularly during important stages of the academic year, like admissions, 
exams, and placement. These investigations are usually made with the use of traditional methods 
(calls, email, in-person visits) which are all time-consuming, frequently redundant and cause an 
enormous amount of workload on the administrative staff. Parallel to this is the fact that students 
automatically seek the right information of materials that are syllabus related, quickly and 
anywhere. Meeting all the needs will still involve a supportive and trustworthy process that is 
capable of automating discrete interactions and improving the service quality. 
In order to overcome this operational problem, an AI-chatbot will be applied to the project to 
support students, specifically in the setting within technical education. The system combines a 
React frontend to communicate with the user and FastAPI on the backend, that makes an inquiry 
through a secure process. The heart of the deployed solution will be Google Gemini (Large 
Language Model) as the chatbot and syllabus information of the university as the data source, and a 
list of frequently asked questions to deliver context-specific solutions, directly associated with the 
questions of students, parents or the staff. As a group implementing it, we talked about the different 
structures we would be required to implement, that would guarantee clarity in functionality of the 
system: User Interface, Chatbot Engine (AI/NLP), Knowledge Base, Backend/API, Admin 
Dashboard, and Deployment and Maintenance. By locating these silos to implement, the following 
modules have an additional opportunity to develop, and organic growth is guaranteed. The other 
environmental factors to further protect applications are API key management; mode to maintain 
dummy data and CORS middleware to ease integration. 
The first step in the implementation was to make the backend create a functional /ask API endpoint 
that could accept student queries and process them to provide the option to integrate the Gemini 
API and provide information in the form of the JSON format. This endpoint has been integrated 
with the frontend and enables real-time communication between the chatbot and the frontend 
through a web interface. Preliminary testing on the systems with dummy and natural questions 
shows that the system could answer many questions and produce natural language responses, which 
agree with the provided context. The results show that the architecture and the integration approach 
are so far viable.
