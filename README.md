# Capstone-Project
Student Assistance Chatbot

This project is a full-stack AI chatbot built to help students, parents, and faculty get instant answers to academic, admission, syllabus, and general college-related queries.
It combines a clean React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and Google Gemini for intelligent, context-aware responses.

Instead of waiting for staff or browsing long PDFs, users can simply ask the chatbot, and get quick, syllabus-aligned replies.
